# DrumCharter Project Plan

DrumCharter is a web application tailored for drummers to create, manage, and share drum charts, practice exercises, and groove snippets. It aims to replace cumbersome word processor templates with a streamlined, interactive tool.

- [x] **High-Quality Output**: Optimized for printing and physical drum charts. `✓`
- [x] **Sharing & Collaboration**: Public/private visibility and public viewing routes. `✓`
- [x] **Notebooks (Ideas & Practice)**: `✓`
  - [x] Data structure for Notebooks (Title, Sections, Flexible Grids) `✓`
  - [x] Support for freeform notes and practice routines `✓`
  - [x] Library View integration `✓`
  - [x] CRUD operations in Supabase `✓`
