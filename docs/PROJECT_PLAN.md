## Project Rules & Collaborative Protocols

To ensure high-quality collaboration and maintain the stability of the DrumCharter codebase, the following protocols are strictly enforced. **These take precedence over all other instructions and are now formally located in `.junie/guidelines.md`.**

### 1. Stop-and-Wait Protocol
- **No Silent Implementation**: Never bundle code fixes, refactors, or new features into a response unless the previous turn was an explicit approval to do so.
- **Explicit Approval Tokens**: Only messages containing clear, affirmative approval (e.g., "Go ahead," "Proceed," "Approved," "Yes, do that") are treated as a green light to make project changes.
- **Step-by-Step Approval**: For multi-step tasks, seek approval for each individual step before moving on to the next.

### 2. Communication Rules
- **Direct Answers First**: If a user asks a question, the entire response must focus on the answer and discussion. Zero code edits or file changes should occur in that turn.
- **Drop and Listen**: When the user stops a task or flags an issue, immediately halt all other activity and address that concern.
- **No Overwhelming Context**: Do not bundle unrelated technical updates or plans into a response to a specific question.
- **Answer-First**: Start every response with a direct, concise answer to the user's question.

### 3. Technical & Mode Rules
- **100% Test Coverage**: All new features and core logic must have corresponding unit (Vitest) and/or E2E (Playwright) tests.
- **Local-First Dev**: Always use the local Supabase Docker instance for development and testing.
- **Commit Identity**: All commits must be made exclusively on behalf of `Nathan Long <nathanlong85@gmail.com>`. No co-author trailers.

## Instructions for Agents
- **Read Before Work**: This file MUST be read before any work is done.
- **Update After Work**: This file MUST be updated after every task is completed.
